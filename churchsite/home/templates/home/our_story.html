            <p>I.P.C Tabernacle begins on January 01, 2016 as an evening fellowship in English for college students and the working class people from different states and language groups working in Bhubaneshwar. It started with a handful of people, but gradually, the number of families and students increased. Later Odia and Hindi was also added as the medium of worship along with English. From the year 2020 onwards, the time of Worship Service was changed to morning instead of evening service. Now, it became a full fledged church with services like baptism, Lord Supper, Sunday School etc.
